      <p>Although increased non-EU imports helped relieve the trade deficit, the expected "dividends" from new global trade relationships after Brexit have not yet materialized. Brexit’s role in driving overall UK trade growth remains limited.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Overall, the combined effects of Brexit, the pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine war have driven substantial changes in the structure of UK trade. Large ports and some core supply chains have remained relatively stable, but regional and sectoral trade are experiencing significant adjustment pressures. The overall gains from Brexit-driven global trade diversification remain limited.</p>

          <h4>Russia-Ukraine Conflict</h4>
          <p>⚪️ Trade in energy, cereals, metals, and fertilizers with Eastern Europe dropped, leading the UK to increase imports of these goods from non-EU countries such as the USA, Canada, and Norway.</p>
          <p>⚪️ To offset reduced supplies from Russia and Ukraine, imports of cereals and fertilizers from the EU also increased.</p>

          <p>⚪️ Non-tariff barriers and regulatory complexity between the UK and EU increased significantly, with the greatest impact on major goods such as machinery, chemicals, and agricultural products.</p>
          <p>⚪️ Major ports like London have remained fairly stable, but small and medium-sized ports saw clear declines in throughput and faced more pressure on logistics chains.</p>  
          <p>⚪️ Container volumes in regional ports declined especially markedly, indicating a structural impact of Brexit on the UK port economy.</p>

          <p>⚪️ Imports of medical and essential food supplies increased for a short period, while sectors like automotive and machinery saw significant declines in both export and import.</p>
