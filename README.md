## Project Overview  

On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom held a historic referendum that marked a pivotal moment in its economic and political history. The decision to leave the European Union (Brexit) not only reshaped the UK's political landscape but also triggered profound structural transformations in its trade relationships and global commodity networks.  

This project leverages data visualisation to present the multidimensional impacts of Brexit on UK trade in a more intuitive and dynamic way. Through interactive graphics, we aim to make complex trade flows and structural changes easily understandable, helping to uncover regional differences and industrial adjustment trends that may be hidden within the data.  

**Our analysis focuses on the following dimensions:**  

- **EU vs. Non-EU Trade Flows:**  
  Examining changes in trade volume and structure between the UK, the EU, and non-EU countries before and after Brexit.  

- **Regional Trade Patterns:**  
  Analysing regional performance differences during Brexit, with a focus on areas such as Greater London, Northern England, and Northern Ireland.  

- **Country and Key Commodity Dimension:**  
  Using the Standard International Trade Classification system, we investigate trade changes for different countries and key commodity categories.  

- **Transportation Modes:**  
  Assessing post-Brexit adaptations in logistics and transportation networks, including maritime and air transport.

## Code Structure  

> **This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), using the Vanilla framework for the web frontend.**  

- The main entry point is `index.html` in the root directory.  
- All major UI components are stored in the `src/components` folder.  
  Each subfolder (e.g., `Transport`, `RegionScale`, `KeyInsights`, `HomePage`, `GoodsType`, `CountryScale`) contains the related HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for each component.  
- Static resources and data files are placed in the `public` folder for easy access by the application.  

Vite provides a fast and modern development experience, allowing us to use a component-based approach for modular, maintainable, and scalable code.
